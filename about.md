<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
	I'm Nikki, a theoretical computer scientist and cryptographer.

    I focus on research in blockchain systems from cryptographic and privacy-based perspectives. I'm especially interested in strategic scientific communications management.

    I enjoy cross-disciplinary work and often explore related fields of theoretical computer science and mathematics for ideas that might inspire bold new directions. I am a proponent of open research, a philosophy of practice that aims to make research more transparent, accessible, and collaborative.
